# IVAO IDVS
Push your controlling on IVAO to the next level

## What is IDVS?
IDVS (abbreviation of "Informationsdatenverarbeitungsprogramm", which is german for: Information processing program) is a program used by the "Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS). Being informed about winds (especially their directions and their speed) is crucial in order to allow for a smooth and efficient use of departure and arrival slots. Thus IDVS provides this data as well as knowledge about the current meteorological and visual conditions returning whether or no these circumstances fulfill the requirement for VMC and therefore allow for VFR-flights.
Fetching data from your ATIS following data is issued:

## What do I need to do to use IDVS for my controller sessions?
1. Firstly, download a zip-file of IDVS (found at the release tab). Unpack it where you want IDVS to be.
2. Secondly, fetch yourself an API key from [AVWX here](https://account.avwx.rest/tokens). No worries, this is at no costs and there are no fees to pay while using IDVS. You have 4k free API requests a day. Requesting once a minute uses 1/3 of this available amount if you were to run IDVS 24 hours daily.
3. Thirdly, you may think about getting some charts to display in the chart box (Keep in mind that size should be 1920*620).

## How do I start IDVS?
1. Double click the .exe file.
2. Enter your callsign on IVAO.
3. If your callsign was correct, you are online and your station features a METAR in its ATIS, you are asked to choose a chart to be displayed in the chart box (File type should be image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) and size should be 1920*620, elsewise the image is stretched).
4. IDVS opens its main window and you are good to go! Have fun!
